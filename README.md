## My Modular personal website

This is a modular personal website that allow me to 
add/delete new information in a modular way. I was inspired to build this app when I was building my personal website. I feel like it is not efficient to add new codes every time I need to add a finished project on my personal website, therefore, I built this app that has an interface thats allow me to enter information, and automatically translate the information into a personal website.
